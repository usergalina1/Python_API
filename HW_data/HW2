If you POST request is successful you should receive a response with the new candidate's ID.
Store the ID for later use

GET the list of existing candidates AGAIN... /candidates
Ensure the count is now greater than before

NOW:
Login as student@example.com and welcome

Delete the candidate you created using the ID you stored
Ensure the candidate was deleted!

BONUS ROUND:
    After creating the new candidate login as the new candidate to ensure the email/password combination works.
    Then delete the new candidate.
    2X BONUS ROUND(if you know loops):
    After creating the new candidate, retrive the list of all candidates and check that one of the entries is the candidate you posted

    After deleting the candidate, retrieve the list of all candidates and check that the deleted candidate is no longer included in the list
